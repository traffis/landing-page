# landing-page

This project is a landing page created using HTML and CSS with flexbox. I understand how to use flexbox a little better after finishing this project, but still have plenty of room to grow. Something I could work on is how I set up my classes so that there isn't too much CSS for styling that is repetitive. Another thing I could work on is aligning items betters so that it's more pleasing to look at.
